# Permutationinator
A program used to generate all possible permutations of the pigpen characters from the crossword/word search puzzle of the Hoarder's Hunt. 
There is a .csv file included in the Permutationinator main folder if all you're after is the data to interrogate!
You're also of course more than welcome to download and use the code in any way you see fit. 
Cheers!
